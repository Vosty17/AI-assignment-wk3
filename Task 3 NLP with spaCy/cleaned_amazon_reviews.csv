121,A. Lee,5.0,update providing an update with regard to sandisk support i bought the memory card in aug  see original review below in may of  while on my cruise to alaska the card went bad during the sailing out of san francisco it was fine as i used it to take a panorama shot of the golden gate bridge for most of the cruise i was using my dslr but the next time i wanted to use my cell phone the phone told me i had no memory card loaded any way tested the card on my laptop when i got back and it couldn t recognize it i contacted sandisk via email and provide them copy of my receipt from amazon along with the serial number on the back of the card very hard to read and no problems they told me to send them back the card and they sent me a brand new card which is now still functioning in my cell phone great support provide by sandisk no hassle as long as you can provide proof of purchase easy to do since amazon keeps my entire purchase history invoices online one reason i buy directly from amazon itself vs other vendors either on amazon or elsewhere on the internet is that i have confidence that the memory cards sold by amazon itself are genuine there may be incredible deals elsewhere on the internet but in some cases the deals are too good to be true and counterfeit cards are being sold original review just received this today removed it from the packaging and inserted it into my samsung galaxy s verizon and powered the unit back up and the storage was available no formatting required worked the first time out settings showed  gb of total space gb version and  gb of free space i like the fact that a sd adapter came with it should i ever need to insert the card into my laptop it will come in handy yes i can plug my phone directly to my laptop but if i ever swap this gb card out of my phone and replace it with a gb version i can use this gb version via the adapter for other purposes,,943,5,0,5,5,1.0,0.5655175352168252,1897

123,Aleksandar Milivojevic,2.0,i bought gb version of the card to use with gopro hero  black edition it didn t work out the card worked ok if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates e g worked fine in p with protune on or p with protune off however in p with protune on bitrate is just shy of  mb s in this mode much higher then with protune turned off it was nothing but trouble camera would sometime work and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason i first suspected camera but testing with different sd cards it ended up being sandisk s card that was at fault my spare card an old and cheap gb pny also class  worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings once it was obvious it was problem with the card i found people on gopro s forums that had trouble with this specific card as well well you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself right anyhow i did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of gb file full of zeros using unix dd utility to copy gb of zeros from dev zero where else would you find that many zeros onto a file on the card the result was that on average sandisk s card would manage about   mb s just barely above the bar for class  card however that was average over gb during the write test the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops drops were as low as mb s uh i thought write speed of class  card should never dip below  mb s for comparison my old cheap class  pny card was chugging along at constant  mb s under the same test no spikes and no drops in speed the card will probably work fine in most devices as bitrates when recording p video are often low enough and or camera might have huge buffer but if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates and your device doesn t have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card you may run into trouble be wary of using it in hero in modes that have higher bit rates e g p with protune enabled sandisk s website lists part numbers as sdsdqui g with adapter and sdsdqua g without adapter this conflicts with product description on amazon while this is likely just amazon not getting product description right again a bit too common thing it s interesting to note update apr   some numbers from testing the card the test is extremely simple write out gb of zeros onto the card using standard unix dd command to read kb blocks of zeroes from special device dev zero and write it onto the card kb  gb dd displays transfer stats once it finishes while dd was running i run iostat in second terminal displaying  second interval stats as a measure of current speed this was done on the mac dd command line can be used as is to repeat test on linux system however iostat command is different on linux and would need to be modified slightly i choose kb block size as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow using different block sizes results are comparable dd if dev zero of test bs  count   records in  records out bytes transferred in   secs  bytes sec so  mb s and all is good right wrong iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this iostat d w  diskdiskkb t tps mb s                                     and so on until dd finishes writing gb of zeros to the card imo the last column should never dip under mb s for card labeled class  for comparison same test run against samsung pro gb micro sd card dd if dev zero of test bs  count   records in  records out bytes transferred in   secs  bytes sec iostat d w  diskdiskkb t tps mb s                                     and so on until dd finishes writing gb of zeros to the card so samsung is on average x faster but more importantly it s speed is much more constant and critically important it never dips under mb s,,644,1,0,1,1,1.0,0.2065493143772374,3766

250,Amazon Customer,5.0,i wasn t absolutely certain if this would work in my samsung galaxy siii an sgh im from a regional carrier here in alaska i read several reviews but took a chance the gb card would work in my device and was pleased when it arrived opting for the  frustration free package  it was a very simple matter to open the little cardboard envelop to retrieve the contents a side note here i do appreciate the amazon packaging for items such as this where a clamshell type of container adds no value the card is well made and seems a quality product installed the card and it was recognized instantly on boot the full capacitywas recognized maybe i am old school when it comes to memory cards but i always format them in the device i intend on using them at least initially in this case there were no issues while i haven t scientifically measured read write speeds of the card performance is respectable i have suffered no issuesrelated to the operation of the card i would highly recommend this product if you are looking for this capacity and your device will accept the microsdxc format to that end several friends have purchased and been satisfied with this memory card in their devices,,590,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1181
251,Amazon Customer,3.0,i will keep it short and sweet for potential buyers looking for facts and not b s i own two of the gb size of these cards for about  months now they do work fairly well with cell phones and tablets yet not so good with cameras in fact these cards failed to work with my gopro hero camera and the customer service rep from gopro claimed and i happen to agree with him that this card is not a true class  card let alone uhs  benchmarks with my evo g with all allocation sizes the write speed never passed beyond mb s while read speeds wondered around mb s far below advertised speeds well write speeds arent technically advertised probably because they are of class  level benchmarks with crystal mark reported speeds even lower due to adapter with write speeds around mb s while read speeds wondered around mb s needless to say if you are not worried about speeds and only about storage these are perfect if you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however i suggest you not to loose your money on this because even if your write speeds are around mb s as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become useless again this review is based on gopro camera and high definition raw recording for cell phones or for storage it works perfectly well with a bit of false advertisement,,524,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1302

266,Amazon Customer,3.0,the package arrived on time it s very well packed and it s got an adapter it works perfectly with my phone though it doesn t allow a computer format once it s been on the phone so it asks you to erase everything before you use it on a computer so if you re planning on buying this for different purposes and devices gotta be aware of this i just need for my phone so i transfer files with my usb cable that works just right i also give it a  star because it says there are gb but even when it s totally formatted it only reaches to gb sooo i don t know where my other  gb are anyways overall it s working well i do think it s expensive for what it is,,579,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,650

1055,Craig,5.0,of late sandisk appears to have lost their way a little with their flash storage products it s almost a universal truth that all of their usb flash drives are hopelessly slow while they re usually reliable transfer rates of mb sec or less are worthless when filling a gb drive fortunately their ultra line of sd cards still appears to buck this trend formatted as ntfs and used in anelago mobile nano ii reader i see write speeds on a  bit linux machine at a consistent  mb sec when copying large gb or larger files to this card which more than lives up to its class  billing reads appear to run at about  mb sec i can t comment on reliability as i ve only had the card a few days but everything i ve copied so far for testing has made it onto the card and off again with no corruption whatsoever the md checksum of every file i ve transferred matches the source that s more than can be said for the supertalent pico usb drive that this sd card and reader are intended to replace which has never been quite right it s always occasionally randomly corrupted files of larger than mb or so and the probability of gb or greater files surviving was near zero gb appears to be the sweet spot at the moment smaller cards don t cost that much less and larger cards are beyond the sdhc spec and into sdxc territory which isn t yet universal in terms of device compatibility not to mention they cost far more than double for gb for what i paid for this around thanksgiving not part of any explicit sale but definitely a lower price than appears usual as far as camelcamelcamel is concerned i m extremely satisfied edit i should also mention that the included mechanical full size sd adaptor is one of the worst i ve ever encountered there s a lot of friction when the microsd card is inserted and it s a right bugger to get it out of the adaptor again thankfully i have a few other such adaptors lying around should i ever need one this one s going in the bin,,970,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1949

1177,Darren S Dale,5.0,i purchased two of these microsdxc cards when they were on sale around black friday and have been using them now for just about two months they work wonderfully and i have had absolutely no problems with either these sandisk memory cards are  gb microsdxc class  uhs  cards which are rated for transfer speeds up to mb sec the uhs class  designation is intended as an performance measure that indicates the card is capable of supporting real time full hd video recording of course this only works if you are using a device which is capable of writing to the card at those speeds but most modern devices that offer full hd recording such as camcorders digital slr cameras and cell phones with built in full hd recording do support this standard the benefit of using a uhs  card on a uhs certified device is that you should not encounter the problem of buffering or your device stopping recording because it could not write fast enough however because these are extra high capacity sdxc cards you will need to make sure that your device can support microsdxc cards and not simply microsd or microsdhc ones the biggest difference is that the microsdxc standard uses the exfat file system rather than the fat or ntfs systems while most modern android devices and in fact most linux unix devices can handle that without difficulty some devices such as older cameras android devices and some windows devices may have difficulty with the format having said that i ve been using these in nikon d d digital slr cameras as well as samsung galaxy s and galaxy s relay g phones without any difficulty and they read write fine on my computers all in all these were a great buy and i m very happy with them,,319,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1692

2031,"Hyoun Kim ""Faluzure""",5.0,update    so my lovely wife bought me a samsung galaxy tab  for father s day and i ve been loving it ever since just as other with samsung products the galaxy tab  has the ability to add a microsd card to expand the memory on the device since it s been over a year i decided to do some more research to see if sandisk offered anything new as of    their product lineup for microsd cards from worst to best performance wise are the as follows sandisksandisk ultrasandisk ultra plussandisk extremesandisk extreme plussandisk extreme pronow the difference between all of these cards are simply the speed in which you can read write data to the card yes the published rating of most all these cards except the sandisk regular are class  uhs i but that s just a rating actual real world performance does get better with each model but with faster cards come more expensive prices since amazon doesn t carry the ultra plus model of microsd card i had to do direct comparisons between the sandisk ultra   extreme   and extreme plus   as mentioned in my earlier review i purchased the sandisk ultra for my galaxy s my question was did i want to pay over  more for a card that is faster than the one i already owned or i could pay almost double to get sandisk s nd most fastest microsd card the ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage storing capturing pictures hd video and movie playback on my phone so in the end i ended up just buying another sandisk ultra gb card i use my cell phone more than i do my tablet and if the card is good enough for my phone it s good enough for my tablet i don t own a k hd camera or anything like that so i honestly didn t see a need to get one of the faster cards at this time i am now a proud owner of  sandisk ultra cards and have absolutely  issues with it in my samsung devices original review    i haven t had to buy a microsd card in a long time the last time i bought one was for my cell phone over  years ago but since my cellular contract was up i knew i would have to get a newer card in addition to my new phone the samsung galaxy s reason for this is because i knew my small gb microsd card wasn t going to cut it doing research on the galaxy s i wanted to get the best card possible that had decent capacity  gb or greater this led me to find that the galaxy s supports the microsdxc class  uhs i card which is the fastest possible given that class searching for that specifically on amazon gave me results of only  vendors as of april that makes these microsdxc class  uhs  cards they are sandisk the majority samsung and lexar nobody else makes these that are sold on amazon seeing how sandisk is a pretty good name out of the  i ve used them the most i decided upon the sandisk because lexar was overpriced and the samsung one was overpriced as well as not eligible for amazon prime but the scary thing is that when you filter by the sandisk you literally get dozens of options all of them have different model numbers different sizes etc then there s that confusion of what s the difference between sdhc sdxc sdhc vs sdxc sdhc stand for secure digital high capacity and sdxc stands for secure digital extended capacity essentially these two cards are the same with the exception that sdhc only supports capcities up to gb and is formated with the fat file system the sdxc cards are formatted with the exfat file system if you use an sdxc card in a device it must support that file system otherwise it may not be recognizable and or you have to reformat the card to fat fat vs exfat the differences between the two file systems means that fat has a maximum file size of gb limited by that file system exfat on the otherhand supports file sizes up to tb terabytes the only thing you need to know here really is that it s possible your device doesn t support exfat if that s the case just reformat it to fat remember formatting erases all data to clarify the model numbers i i hopped over to the sandisk official webpage what i found there is that they offer two highspeed options for sandisk cards these are sandisk extreme pro and sandisk ultra sandisk extreme pro is a line that supports read speeds up to mb sec however they are sdhc only to make things worse they are currently only available in gb gb capacities since one of my requirements was to have a lot of storage i ruled these out the remaining devices listed on amazon s search were the sandisk ultra line but here confusion sets in because sandisk separates these cards to two different devices cameras mobile devices is there a real difference between the two or is this just a marketing stunt unfortunately i m not sure but i do know the price difference between the two range from a couple cents to a few dollars since i wasn t sure i opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue to find the exact model number i would go to sandisk s webpage sandisk com and compare their existing product lineup from there you get exact model numbers and you can then search amazon for these model numbers that is how i got mine sdsdqua g as for speed tests i haven t run any specific testing but copying  gb worth of data from my pc to the card literally took just a few minutes one last note is that amazon attaches additional characters to the end for example sdsdqua g affp a vs sdsdqua g ua the difference between the two is that the affp a means amazon frustration free packaging other than that these are exactly the same if you re wondering what i got and want to use it in your galaxy s i got the sdsdqua g ua and it works like charm,,702,1952,68,2020,1884,0.9663366336633664,0.9575439475520824,5614

2576,J. Van Wagenen,5.0,i had been using a regular sandisk gb micro sd card that came included with my htc thunderbolt i bought in  the size was decent but i never realized until upgrading how much i was lacking on the speed i finally got one of these to replace my old card with my galaxy s it is superb i just recently got a galaxy s and again this card is just about the best expansion you can add to most any phone with my old microsd card i had gotten used to just sitting there zoning out as i waited patiently for my computer to transfer pictures videos off my card to be backed up to my pc s hard drive or copying some music files from my pc to my card with this new card almost any single file even hundreds of megabytes big is an instant transfer that transfers too quick to even bring up that  moving  dialog box in windows  on my very big transfers lots of hd video files at once totaling several gigabytes i have to wait but i m waiting for seconds instead of minutes combine the excellent speed with the fact that gb can hold a ton of data compared to typical storage sizes on phones and you have a very satisfied customer now i can procrastinate even longer the occasional transfers of all my pictures and videos to my pc though i try not to a lot of phones like my s specify gb sdxc cards as the maximum they support so this is about the best you can even get for the moment unless you want to pay almost double for sandisk s extreme cards unless you have money to burn i think these are a much better value and diminishing returns certainly kick in beyond this price point but perhaps my next phone will support k hd video onto gb cards and i will yet again need to upgrade my card s capacity and speed anyway bottom line on this product awesome,,190,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1738

2799,Lazer Fers,4.0,i purchased the card in the sandisk packaging so i am pretty sure it is genuine i tested it with various programs on the web that apparently can detect whether they are fakes or not this one turned out to be a real sandisk card the card came formatted with fat i read on the web about these micro sds and apparently they are not as fast as the full sd card version i borrowed my brothers sandisk gb full sd card to make comparison tests here are my official unofficial test results using diskbench v    and htestw   test i will give the results as an overall result because after testing these cards over and over with speed writes and reads the results get mixed and varied to a big degree much larger than i expected but the numerous tests showed me a general trend the trend is that the full sd cards do write faster than the microsd card but also remember that the microsd had to be put into an adapter to do the test on my pc while the fullsd card was put into the computer reader directly these are just my averages but small file writes both sd cards wrote at close to mb sec the microsd was less consistent in the tests and sometimes dropped to mb sec small file reads both sd cards read at close to  mb sec at their fastest large file copies to card microsd wrote at  mb sec while the fullsd wrote at about mb seclarge file reads copies from card microsd was mb sec while the fullsd read at about mb sec my conclusion my tests were by no means official for this card and showed much variance dependent on file size of the reads and writes but the fullsd card was faster in many cases but equal to microsd in most cases the small file writes and reads showed that they are similar enough but my only concern is with large file writes is   mb sec good enough for rapid photography on a high pixel camera i don t know i have had no problem using these cards with h movie capture for hours i am surprised that   mb sec is enough also never during the huge file copies to the card did i get any noticeable heating of the card itself by touch even for an hour i ve noticed that it has been a complaint from many people on the web some stating that they felt they might burn themselves i copied files that took more than an hour with no noticeable temperature change other than perhaps a couple of degrees of course this was on a pc and not installed in a camera the card performs well for video work and appears to meet many other tests performed by other people i never saw a read close to  mb sec they were very consistent at  mb sec at the highest performance i would get the card again if the price were right,,779,1,1,2,0,0.5,0.0945312057342307,2616

2934,mad G.I.,1.0,i bought this card originally for my galaxy note ii with the intentions of using it as my primary downloader but i could not get it to format correctly for the phone even using third party format software i then tried it in my galaxy tab  plus same problems i finally and ridiculously put the card in my nikon d camera i could take a whopping k photos on high large settings not that i would ever need to take that many photos in one session this was the last option i had to use the card it worked well taking photos of a holiday and thankfully it did not fail before i could get my photos onto a computer since then i have inserted it back in the camera and reformatted like you always should and bam one photo is good after that failure every single time so now i have a gb card that is capable of taking and storing one photo at a time before i must run a fix file system on my computer don t waste your money on this card over priced not really faster than the other cards i have and zero longevity this may be a one off but i think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exfat that makes this card a loser or more to the point the poor customer who buys it update july after contacting sandisk they have offered an rma but first they must verify that i have not tried to recover or wipe the data on the card and i must ship it at my expense to taiwan i have since emailed them in reply to the requested information date of purchase photos of the card packaging ect and i told them that the data on their is my data and if i could have accessed the card i would have wiped it why should i give them my information stored on the card that makes me less than happy i am guessing that they want to discourage returns who would want to send data to a company not knowing who will access it and what they will do with the information contained i would have wiped the card but it was unreadable unable to format unable to do anything i will send it to them hoping that the information is destroyed along with the bad card sandisk you are asking a whole lot of your customers and since this card has gone bad i have had several other cards from them go bad as well seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods i used to love their products and their older flash drives are great still using a micro cruzer that is  years old and going strong i have not had one single microsd card from this company last more than three months since i moved to the philippines either they send their junk to the philippines or they have dropped qc from their business model to create higher profit margins update  after emailing sandisk and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item intact so that they can assess the card and look at recover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card they rescinded i can only assume that they want to get the card back to verify that it is bad or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them which i can understand instead of requiring me to send the card back to them they asked that i cut the card and send a photo of the destroyed card so they could process a new card to be sent to me directly in the philippines i hammered them pretty hard in this review and in the email i sent to them regarding the bad card and sometimes you get results in this case i give them  stars for doing the right thing i had no problem cutting the card since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway but i did have a problem returning the device intact with out knowing what information was stored on the card banking amazon account info passwords ect i would have just kept the card destroyed it and never bought another from sandisk with their faith restoring gesture i will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid i just hope that they get better at qc i returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday only to find out that you must have the original packaging for a replacement i was lucky to still have one of my packages but since i bought several of the cards i am not sure if i gave them the matching package for the card i returned i would suggest that if you are like me and have several devices  dslr s galaxy tab galaxy note  sii lg p that you find a way to mark each card package and keep the package in the case that the card should go bad i have had more than half of my sandisk gb cards fail on me in less than  months i only buy them because of the cards available in my area these are the best which is scary with such a high failure rate,,558,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,4597

2993,Mark R. Wietstock,5.0,i got my wife a samsung galaxy tab    for christmas and it took awhile for her to start figuring out all the things it can do once she did that led of course to her wanting to watch movies on it that was my signal to spring into action that is if i wanted to prevent her from running wild buying digital copies of every movie we already have in dvd or blu ray you can t play dvd or blu ray movies on this device but you can use your computer s dvd or blu ray drive and commonplace third party software to convert movies in this format into mp and or several other types of video files that can be played on this tablet since this particular tablet is capable of playing high definition video screen resolution is  x  pixels and we want to use all of that high def capability my conversion files tend to be pretty large average  to gb per movie way too big to be stored on the tablet s limited internal memory that s where the tablet s microsd slot and this sandisk flash memory comes in i make huge mp s store them separately on a   terabyte drive and then load as many of them as i can on this chip which shows up in the tablet as a separate memory source then all you have to do is pull up one of the movie files from the card and hit play you can use the device s standard video player or get an app with more controls watching high def video on a tablet that s streaming the data from a memory card rather than the tablet s internal memory requires a memory card with very high read speed and this sandisk card s class  rating fills that bill that s the difference between cheaper microsd that s primarily designed for simple data storage and microsd that s designed for higher active transfer read speeds the class  designation generally means that the subject card will transfer data at a minimum rate of mb per second this sandisk ultra card is capable of transferring data at speeds of up to mb per second depending on the speed of the device you re using it in and other particulars of the way you re using the device frustration free packaging means the chip sd adapter and plastic case comes in a little sealed cardboard envelope with a pull tab opener this card comes pre formatted for android and my use of it in the galaxy tab  for watching high def mp movies has thus far been flawless finally don t let yourself get burned by counterfeiters in trying to save a buck while pricing on memory tends to fluctuate amazon s current pricing on this card is very competitive with any all vendors out there selling genuine sandisk ultra memory buy from amazon or other trustworthy vendor because i just learned the hard way that these memory cards are being counterfeited in huge numbers that is the counterfeiters are placing sandisk labeling packaging on inferior generic microsd and selling the bogus chips on ebay and anywhere else they can i bought three from amazon after i got burned by a chinese seller on ebay the counterfeit packaging and labeling was good enough to fool me until i actually tried one of the chips in the galaxy tab  the write speed that is the amount of time it takes to transfer files onto the microsd card was dramatically worse than the speed of a genuine sandisk ultra card and the read speed was totally inadequate for playing movies on the galaxy tab  i may never have figured it out at all if i didn t already have one other genuine sandisk ultra with which to compare the fakes if you want the best most reliable memory for the microsd slot on your shiny new android device look no further this is it,,163,1,0,1,1,1.0,0.2065493143772374,3543

3345,M. Stanley Bubien,5.0,my review is a little backwards  but i thought the most relevant should go first warning only buy this card on sale the typical price since summer  is about  for  gb and about  for  gb do not pay any more than this and you can actually pay less if you have the luxury of time patience the lowest non lightning price hit about   for gb and  for gb in early december i basically buy when the price hits  or less and the  nears   from december  to january  i watched these cards change price on an almost daily basis they initially went on sale for about   and   for  and  respectively i watched them slowly increase in price with random dips and peaks for a month on january th  they still show as a  best deal on amazon  for   more days  but they are at the highest price point since last summer and higher than i have ever payed for these cards so don t let the  best deals  section deceive you at   these are not a  deal  in terms of price okay here s my actual  review  of these absolutely great sdxc cards i have tried a variety of microsdxc cards and so far the samsung ultra uhs are the best and the price can t be beat for all the most important reasons speed capacity reliability durability i have not had a single failure and i use these cards in my nook hd nexus   via usb and my canon d mark ii with converter and macbook pro in the card slot they re durable and waterproof and i can use the same card in all these devices without reformatting i even had one go through the wash and i still use it for pictures for the technically inclined i have cards with both the clockwork mod bootloader for the nook hd and the magiclantern firmware for my canon eos d ii on the same card i can pull it from the nook shoot pictures with the camera and look at the results on the nook by just pulling the card out of one device and placing it in the other this should be possible with any sdxc sdhc card but it turns out that the samsung uhs is the only card i ve found that works reliably some cards won t boot because they re too slow too finicky but all my samsung uhss work great the gb will not boot in the nook but no gb card will i keep my eyes open for price drops on these cards because they ve performed so well for me samsung also has a newer faster card but its price point hovers somewhere north of  prohibitive  so i still stick with these and that s good news regardless because as the new card increases its market share these should drop even further in price,,190,2,0,2,2,1.0,0.3423802275066531,2473

3449,NLee the Engineer,5.0,i have tested dozens of sdhc and micro sdhc cards one disturbing trend i noticed is that the speed class rating for micro sdhc is typically inflated for example a class  rating means the card must deliver a sequential write speed of at least mb s but somehow a class  microsdhc cards is always slower than a class  sdhc card from the same manufacturer case in point thepny  gb microsdhc card p sdug efs claims to be class  yet it can only write at  mb s maximum while the full sizepny p sdhcgachieved  mb s according to crystaldiskmark v  thissandisk ultra  gb microsdhc class  uhs  card sdsdqua g ua however proves to be the exception it achieved a sequential write speed of over mb s according to two different benchmark programs  mb s in crystaldiskmark  mb s in htestw v  this is faster than all my other microsdhc cards including two class  cards frompnyandpolaroid a closer look at the file transfer speed using flash memory toolkit revealed another nice surprise for writing small files this sandisk ultra microsdhc card performed just as well as its full size counterpart thesandisk ultra sdhc sdsdu g affp in contrast all my other class  microsdhc cards perform poorly while writing smaller files see the benchmark results i uploaded to customer images for details when you use a memory card in a digital camera to record hd video it needs to store a huge video file each session that means its sequential write speed is most critical when used in a tablet or a smart phone however the card s random write speed for small files is more important that s why in such applications the sandisk microsdhc will perform faster than the pny and polaroid cards even though they are also rated as class  bottom line as of this writing the sandisk ultra microsdhc card ia actually priced lower than other class  cards from pny and polaroid this makes the sandisk the best value especially if you need honest class  performance across all platforms side notes do not confuse this sandisk ultra card withsandisk mobile ultra microsdhc sdsdqy g ua the latter is rated for class  only the size of this gb card is  gb according to my computer this is actually normal because computer people count one gig as  to the power  which is   larger than one billion so  gb translates to   billion bytes which is gb according to marketing people update on feb    amazon combined the sandisk ultra gb and gb cards on the same product page please beware that your intended appliance must be compatible with sdxc in order to used the gb version my original review refers to the gb sdhc version  there are two part numbers for the same card if you start from the amazon product page and select retail packaging you ll see the part number of sdsdqua g ua but if you click on frustration free package the part number changes to sdsdqu g affp a update on oct   the sandisk microsdhc card works great in my new samsung galaxy s without the need for reformat the default format is fat update on dec   my old test results were limited by the card reader and usb   port used i re tested the sandisk uhs micro card using thetranscend rdf card readerconnected to an usb   port here are the results from crystaldiskmark   x sequential read speed  mb s was  mb s when connected to usb   port sequential write speed  mb s was  mb s when connected to usb   port,,803,1428,77,1505,1351,0.9488372093023256,0.9365186121207498,3328

3757,"rbhatta ""A Dinosaur you can trust!""",4.0,the primary reason for buying this extra capacitysandisk ultra  gb microsdxc class card was to use it insamsung galaxy tab    inch model gt p and i am happy to share that you can get this to work flawlessly after some initial glitches read below firstly you need to be aware that the samsung tablet model gt p currently runs with android os    with kernel     and build number jroc pueclk jelly bean my experiences shared here are with that level of android os your experiences may vary depending on what version of os you are running the sandisk ultra  gb microsdxc card purchased from amazon retail packaging gets recognized just fine however when the tablet s media device a k a mtp application attempts to talk your pc via usb cable the tablet simply reboots and after that the card is presented to the pc really strange indeed this baffled me for couple of hours firstly i attempted to format the card exfat in pc and it formatted just fine after that i attempted to use it in the tablet to see the same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of the tablet as mtp application tries to communicate with the pc this made me investigate the issue further and i determined the root cause was the fact that sandisk now seen to factory format the card with exfat but also somehow seen to include an offset of mb at the beginning of the card which shows up as mb unallocated region in the initial sectors on this card under windows disk management tool the solution is to get rid of that unallocated mb partition on the card you could do it in pc but that might require some windows command line experience and using diskpart utility and what not and i do not want to confuse people here with that process for most novice users the process should be very simple just insert the card on the tablet and use the native sd card format tool under settings that android os    has and it will get rid of that mb partition and happily remount it now after this simple process the mtp application works just fine with pc to transfer files to the sd card without any strange reboot phenomenon not sure why sandisk formats their class  card in this fashion they never did it with their class  cards earlier and there s gotta be some technical explanation for why they include that mb partition that only sandisk can give in the end if you reformat the card in the tablet which defaults to exfat the card is seen to work just fine bottomline this is an awesome gb capacity microsd card from a reputed manufacturer for budget minded people and gets the job done beautifully the read and write speeds are adequate enough for most audio video picture file formats in a tablet the glitch mentioned above forced me to give four stars instead of five stars but let that not stop you from making a decision to buy it highly recommended cheers,,581,2,0,2,2,1.0,0.3423802275066531,2824

4212,SkincareCEO,1.0,note please read the last update scroll to the bottom i m leaving this review as  star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experience i give sandisk  stars for customer service and  star for the product for those manufactured in the past for those newly manufactured products that contain the software rom fix i d give the product  stars to all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews and then used it in a galaxy s gs smartphone for storage the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to sandisk for a replacement under warranty believe me i tried everything that the google searches returned as solutions formatting as exfat formatting in the gs then copying data to the card while in the phone etc nothing worked and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which i hope to get soon just rma d and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warranty the problem as confirmed from the sandisk customer support rep when i asked specifically asked him when used in the gs this card will unmount itself inadvertently may be true only for cards manufactured before the rom patch described below was implemented in manufacturing this can cause the data to become corrupt luckily was not my experience and or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving  mp camera pictures to the card or mp movies that stop in the middle of the movie and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse right when you take the picture this was the issue i experienced sandisk knows about this issue again sandisk knows about the issue and will replace your card call them info below and they will take care of it under warranty they have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it sorry sandisk about the  star but i thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution the customer rep told me that sandisk tried to work with samsung to resolve the issue but samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones especially their flagship gs phones the customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras not samsung gs phones with cameras obviously and even worked fine in some phones from htc etc that could accommodate the  gb cards hence the  star ratings from others the solution sandisk came up with was to write a patch into the rom of the card itself to specifically address the issue on samsung gs phones and maybe other samsung phones like the gs i was assured that the new card i would get would work flawlessly will see in about  weeks i purchased my card from amazon june  so the ones currently being manufactured and the one i should get will have the new patch however as sandisk manufactures in batches like most of the industry old batches of unpatched cards obviously exist in warehouses i asked about a software patch i could download and was told it s not possible hence the hard coded patch in the card s romso how to take care of the problem after speaking with the sandisk us customer support link and info below this is what i learned and did go to the sandisk site  call consumer products support this is the us no   sandisk    tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your gs i assume this is also a problem experienced by gs owners too  they will then confirm your information approve your return   min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously and then send you emails with a ups return label and instructions  btw they also asked if i had a magnifying glass to id the serial no on the card but i didn t and couldn t read it myself those numbers are super small printed into the plastic don t believe me take a look yourself i told the rep i couldn t read them and he said no problem they would process without the serial no i assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in makes sense well that s it problem hopefully solved let s see in   weeks the rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem kudos to sandisk for taking care of it however it would be nice if there was some type of communication notice of the issue besides google info sources forums etc i spent hours maybe a couple of days total hours worth thinking it was an issue with my phone my data transfer oh well that s how it goes i really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me good luck btw i d give the card  stars if this problem was solved in the patched rom of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer if the data transfer remaining mounted in the gs issue never existed pre patch of rom of course update    all went well with the return of the sandisk storage card ups shipping took about  days from when i sent it sandisk verified the warranty claim  day later and  hours later that same day my replacement card had been shipped waiting on the new card now but expect to test it out very soon early next week will update the post after testing out the new card just as a reference i ve been using a gb micro sd hc sandisk card in the gs since having shipped the gb card obviously it s a different card and not the micro sd xc kind other than a bit slower access speeds to the card absolutely zero problems well if you don t count that it s basically filled up hence why the gb option is great on the gs so it proves the point on the problem with the early build micro sd xc gb cards i m happy to see that my review has helped some others out there good luck to you in your warranty claim my experience with sandisk customer support has been excellent so far update    received the new replacement sandisk storage card just a few days ago shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window have had it running in the galaxy s for a few days now without any jumps stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking card seems to work flawlessly as the sandisk rep mentioned it would one would think it s such a short time to test after a few days of use but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first  minutes that s how often and how fast it was occurring so it would seem the problem is solved the new sd card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card thanks sandisk unless i update this review by next week you will know that the problem has been fixed good luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to sandisks great responsive customer service update    this is the last update to this review just to close the loop the new replacement card from sandisk has been running flawlessly for about  weeks now i have not experienced any of the initial problems sandisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cards update    the card has been running in my gs flawlessly since replacing it around aug st pretty good track record so far   months so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured replacement cards for those that have left comments that i should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed see my addition at the beginning of this review when searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product most people start at the  star reviews to see what others have experienced this is especially true for products with a lot of reviews this is what i did in the beginning with this product therefore i think leaving it at  star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review thanks to review commenter da shocker for his input i think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like this one more thing to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star a card cost   pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless,,579,1568,126,1694,1442,0.9256198347107438,0.9121388936795274,8241

4220,Skywalker,4.0,never had a problem with any sd cards prior and always had a good track record with sandisk products card was working great at first used exclusively in my samsung galaxy s enjoyed the extra space got the gb card and transfers were pretty quick i started to see about a month ago that the phone would randomly give me sd card unexpectedly removed error maybe once a week the last  weeks i also started seeing frequently sd card safe to remove randomly pop up at least once a day as well as the unexpected removal error every few days today the card stopped reading all together the card was first inserted w the phone off when i bought it although i never formatted it it worked properly i also never removed the card from the phone in order to possibly corrupt it from improper removal so the card just seems to have died of it s own accord i never thought to check it s temperature after transferring large files so i m not sure if i had the same issue as another reviewer contacted sandisk waiting for reply if they replace the card and it works well i will revise this review update   got a replacement card after about a week and a half sandisk supplied a shipping label for me which is always a plus i ve had the replacement in my s for   months now and still going strong i ve also used it with the adapter in my gopro card is working well and hopefully it continues to do so updated to  stars since i haven t had a single problem with this card the first one started showing issues fairly soon after installing maybe there was just a bad batch of the card for spell there,,1031,1,0,1,1,1.0,0.2065493143772374,1579

4235,S. Melvin,5.0,with most of the world s electronic devices finally standardizing to sd thank you sony for finally adopting this standard it seems most things we own work on either the microsd or regular sd card that s why this little package is so handy you get both in one neat little package and at gb you ll have plenty of space to store most of your programs files etc on your device the class  rating ability to move data on off card at the current maximum speed is a must for anyone that doesn t want to sit for vital seconds waiting for data to write to the card and sandisk has proven themselves over the years as making a quality product sure you may occasionally find a dud in their inventory but they are quick to fix replace it and that is what matters most buying cheaper cards will land you with a read write error when you can least afford it don t be the person that loses those important family photos or that document that is due today because of a cheap and defective card i purchased this particular card for my asus transformer as it fits nicely into the pad itself and with the optional keyboard attachment which is capable of holding standard sd cards it fits there as well making this the perfect solution for my extra memory needs and at a much better bargain than most competitors you can certainly purchase more internal memory on your iproduct or android device most seem to have gb or gb variants but why spend the extra cash for gb extra when you can buy far more in an external card,,547,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1498

4302,Stayeraug,5.0,so i got this sd specifically for my gopro black  simply hoping it would work since the gopro manual says  use cards up to gb  and the sandisk says it s good for cell phones and tablets yet doesn t mention the gopro well turns out it works perfect and although i haven t tried it on other devices i think if it works flawlessly on the gopro it will work even better on anything else so at first i thought maybe since it s only mbps there may be frame rate issues with recording even though i knew that shouldn t be the case well after popping it in the gopro says hrmin p super view video which is insane i put it on my helmet and took it for a spin when i came home after spending the day on the bike the hd quality was spectacular granted it s all thanks to the camera itself but it was smooth with zero frame rate issues the only flaw is the semi long time it takes to copy files to your hard drive as it copies at only mbps but honestly that s really no big deal and totally worth it still bottom line this sd plus the gopro  is the best camera combination for your money p s it s small simple durable and has no lock feature which i always found to be an annoyance anyway any questions please feel free to comment and i will do my best to answer,,262,14,2,16,12,0.875,0.6397717273424132,1250

4423,"T. Brown ""TB""",3.0,maybe there is nothing that can be done and it is just the way the technology is at this time but to me it seems that the gb sd cards have very limited uses at this time because they are formatted in whats called exfat instead of the standard fat to get gb from a gb card after receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with jelly bean it was recognized and it did show i had gb available i then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers a win and a vista and tried to transfer files photos and videos from my laptop to the card they would not transfer after some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new exfat to the standard fat all my files were created in win xp and win vista fat i also have a win machine i recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exfat i had read on the internet about reformatting the cards and it working my win machine does not even have the option to format to standard fat it only has nstf and exfat my older computers have the older fat format option and it took my vista computer with a dual core processor  hours to reformat the card to fat after reformatting i was able to easily transfer my files photos and videos on my xp and vista computers but not the win computer the card works in my tablet and i am able to access and use all the files i transferred to the card in fat with my vista computer on the tablet but after reformatting it now the card only has gb of space available so it was essentially reformatted the gb card into a gb card i will keep the card because i have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future i can reformat it again back to exfat if and when exfat catches on and an os is made that can seamlessly use files created in both fat and exfat this seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big gb card that can be used for everything in every device unless all your files photos and videos are in or will be created with exfat there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower gb cards if you really need this much storage space in a micro sd card or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exfat and double the capacity if your computer has the exfat reformat option i have not tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems like it would work if exfat works for you i gave  stars because it does work but i feel sandisk not fully explaining how they are getting gb out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have with it is misleading advertising,,475,1,0,1,1,1.0,0.2065493143772374,2940
