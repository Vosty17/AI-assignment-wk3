# Magic Number Guesser

This project is a simple yet powerful web application built with Streamlit and TensorFlow that predicts handwritten digits (0-9) using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). You can upload an image of a number, and the app will process it and tell you what digit it thinks it is, along with its confidence level.

## Features
- **Smart Number Detection**: CNN model with >95% accuracy
- **Instant Feedback**: See predictions in real-time
- **Confidence Breakdown**: Visual percentage for each digit
- **Kid-Friendly**: Simple interface with emoji reactions
- **Educational**: Shows the AI's "thought process"

## Tech Stack
- `TensorFlow` for the neural network
- `Streamlit` for the web interface
- `Pillow` for image processing
- `NumPy` for number crunching

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Installation
```bash```
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Vosty17/AI-assignment-wk3.git

# 2. Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Train the model
Before running the app, you need to train the digit recognition model. This will create the mnist_model.h5 file.
Run the Jupyter notebook to train and save the model:

jupyter notebook train_number_model.ipynb

This script will download the MNIST dataset, train a CNN model for 5 epochs, and save the trained model. You should see a high test accuracy (e.g., 95-99%) printed at the end of the training process, indicating a well-trained model.

# 5. Run the Streamlit App
Once the model is trained and saved, you can launch the Streamlit application:
streamlit run app-lit.py
This command will open the application in your default web browser.

# Usage
- **Open the App:** After running streamlit run app-lit.py, the app will open in your browser.

- **Upload an Image:** Click the "Choose a number picture:" button to upload an image file (PNG, JPG, JPEG) containing a single handwritten digit (0-9).

- **View Processed Image:** The app will display a processed version of your uploaded image.

- **Click Predict:** Click the "Predict" button to get the model's prediction.

- **See Results:** The app will show the predicted digit and the model's confidence for that prediction, along with a breakdown of confidence for all digits (0-9).

# Model Details
The core of this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset.

- **Architecture:** The model consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction, max-pooling layers for downsampling, a flatten layer to convert feature maps into a 1D vector, and dense layers for classification.

- **Training:** It's trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. The training process runs for 10 epochs to achieve high accuracy.

- **Performance:** A well-trained model on MNIST can achieve test accuracies of 95-99%, leading to high confidence in predictions for new, well-formed handwritten digits.

# Tips for Best Results
For the most accurate predictions from the model, keep these tips in mind when preparing your images:

- **Centered Numbers:** Draw the digit in the center of the image.

- **Thick Lines:** Use bold, thick lines for your digits.

- **White Digits on Dark Background:** The model was primarily trained on images with white (or light) digits on a black (or dark) background. The app tries to invert images if they are mostly light, but adhering to this style directly helps.

- **Single Digit:** Only include one digit per image.

- **Clear and Legible:** Avoid overly messy or abstract drawings.
